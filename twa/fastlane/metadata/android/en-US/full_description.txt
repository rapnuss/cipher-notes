Ciphernotes is an end-to-end encrypted notebook that keeps your text safe even when it syncs through the cloud. Every note is encrypted before it leaves your device, so the server only sees ciphertext.

Key features:
- Capture, edit, and read notes from any browser or device that knows the shared key.
- Share the encryption key with trusted devices instantly using QR codes.
- No account or password required; the key lives locally and can be exported whenever you need it.
- Open source backend and frontend so you can self-host or review how your data is handled.

Ciphernotes runs on https://ciphernotes.com and the Android app wraps the same PWA using a Trusted Web Activity.
