Summary: Client-side encrypted notebook that syncs via shareable keys.
Description: |
  Ciphernotes lets you capture and sync notes that are encrypted before they ever
  leave your device. The Android app bundles the Progressive Web App in a Trusted
  Web Activity so you can pin it to your launcher with a native splash screen.

  Features:
  * End-to-end encryption with keys kept in local storage on each device.
  * Share keys across devices with QR codes to sync instantly.
  * No login or password required for offline use.
  * Built with open source client, server, and infrastructure so you can
    self-host if you prefer.
